## My Portfolio site
Hello! Nice to meet you! This is my portfolio site, which I designed and developed. All my recent work is showcased on the site. Please take a look if you have time!💙

### Installation 
If you want to review my code, please make sure you downloaded the following development tools:
1. **VS Code** - this is essential for front-end development!
2. **SASS plug-in** - It is really handy for styling multiple HTML pages. I love storing reusable items as variables.
3. **SASS Compiler plug-in** - This is a must if you're using SASS; it helps compile your file to main.css.
5. **GreenSock plug-in** - I used Scroll Trigger, Scroll To and Text Plug to create animations for my site. You may visit [gsap](https://gsap.com) for more information. 
4. MAMP - I added dynamic content to my portfolio page. I am still in the learning process, although it always gives me a hard time.

### Usage
Open index.html in your browser (I personally use Google Chrome).
