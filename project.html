                <h3>Project Details:</h3>
                <p>This assignment for the second semester of the Interactive Media Design program involved rebranding the discontinued kids' beverage brand, Burple. Our task was to develop a new logo, product packaging, poster, and promotional video. Since the brand targets children, we focused on creating a design that's vibrant, colorful, and fun. To capture the playful and energetic spirit of a kid's drink, we infused dynamic, lively elements into both the logo and packaging.</p>

                <h3>Issue:</h3>
                <p>Through our research, we discovered that one of the standout features of the original Burple brand was its expandable plastic bottle. However, we couldn't replicate the exact design for our rebranding. After brainstorming, we decided on a round-shaped bottle, which is more practical for kids to store and reuse as a water bottle. The challenge we faced was crafting the perfect shape in Cinema 4D, as the unique bottle design required precise modeling to achieve the desired look.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p>After several attempts and referencing a few online resources, we created a path for the bottle and integrated it into the 3D model. Once the shape of the bottle was finalized, we focused on adding a realistic plastic texture to the label and simulating liquid/juice inside the bottle for added realism. After watching tutorials, we enhanced the scene by incorporating a background and adjusting the lighting, achieving a satisfying and polished look. Additionally, we added a small liquid path to further enhance the realism.</p>
